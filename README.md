# Isgalamido Adventures: A Log Parser Challenge

This project is about a log parser, capable of reading a log file, grouping the data of each game, collecting their respective information.

This information is based on the Quake 3 Arena server. This server records all game events, such as:
- Start of a game;
- End of a game;
- Slaughter;
- Deaths;
- Between others. 
## Features

### ✅  Task 1
    - [x]  Add the “games.log” file somewhere within your project and ignore it so that it is not versioned in .gitignore

    - [x]  Create a main file (main.c, main.rb, main.py, etc) that should load this file and make a print (“print”) of its first line;

    - [x]  Create a test file to test this main to understand if the read is behaving as expected;

    - [x]  Feel free to make use of programming techniques that your programming language can offer, such as using object orientation or functional programming;

    - [x]  Also handle the error if the file does not exist and create automated tests to do so;

    - [x]  Change your README to add instructions on how to install the language used, and also run the main file and automated tests;

    - [x]  Don't forget to close the file as needed so that the file doesn't stay in memory unnecessarily;
